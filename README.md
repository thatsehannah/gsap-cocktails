# 🍸 GSAP Cocktails

An animated, scroll-drived cocktail showcase built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **GSAP**. This project brings cocktail recipes to life with smooth motion, parallax scrolling, dynamic transitions, with a twist where the user animates through a video frame by frame as they scroll down the page.

## 🌟 Features

- 🌀 Scroll-triggered animations with GSAP and ScrollTrigger
- 🍹 Cocktail cards with staggered entrance and hover motion effects
- 🌈 Responsive design with fluid layout and clean UI
- 🖼️ Background transitions and blur effects based on cocktail categories

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – frontend framework
- **TypeScript** – static typing for predictable components
- **GSAP** – industry-standard animation platform
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger** – scroll-based triggers and parallax effects
- **Tailwind CSS** – for scoped, maintainable styling

## 🧠 Learnings

This project deepened my understanding of scroll-driven animations and how to use GSAP effectively inside a Next.js app. It also pushed me to think like a creative developer who wants their products to stand out while still balancing solid performance.
